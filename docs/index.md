# Abstract {-}

The **Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS)** is a nationally representative study conducted by the **Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA)** in collaboration with the **World Bank**. Its objective is to collect detailed information on various aspects of Ethiopian households, such as expenditure on goods and services, income, employment, agricultural production, and living conditions. The data collected in the ESS are essential for policy formulation and evaluating the impact of development programs in the country. This survey enables the analysis of consumption patterns and economic inequalities across different regions, distinguishing between urban and rural areas to identify trends and specific population needs.

In this study, multiple analyses have been conducted using ESS data, applying data processing and visualization techniques to examine household income and expenditure patterns. Bar charts have been created to illustrate the distribution of spending on non-food items, histograms to assess the density of expenditure across different categories, and scatter plots to explore the relationship between per capita income and expenditure. Additionally, weighted statistical models have been implemented, considering the survey's sampling structure to ensure representative and robust estimates. These analyses help identify key differences in the economic behavior of Ethiopian households, providing valuable insights for designing interventions and policies aimed at improving the populationâ€™s well-being.
