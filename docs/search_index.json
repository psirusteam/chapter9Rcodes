The researcher will be faced to a small dataset containing information that will allow her to make conclusions over the whole population. The purpose of any analysis on this kind is not to make conclusions about the sample itself – which in most of the cases is a small subset of the population - but to the the whole population and possibly domains or population subgroups of interest. Having that into account, the first step in any analysis plan should be devoted to understanding and specifying the sampling design used to draw the sample and the findings on the field related to nonresponse and lack of coverage. This chapter covers three main topics of analysis: descriptive statistics; comparisons and associations; and modeling of survey data. First, we introduce simple descriptive statistics, such as totals, means, frequencies and proportions, quantiles and some graphics; next, we delve deeper on relationships between the survey variables. All these analyses rely on the representativity principle of the design-based inference. This way, the reader will find a strong focus, not only on point estimates, but also on uncertainty measures. The chapter also presents a short discussion on the different approaches that can be used to estimate variances; the best way to visualize the estimates; and some NSO practical experiences.

Its objective is to provide high-quality data for the analysis of poverty, food security, agricultural development, and other key socioeconomic aspects. The ESS4 is part of a series of longitudinal surveys initiated in 2011 under the name Ethiopia Rural Socioeconomic Survey (ERSS). In its first two rounds, the survey only covered rural areas and small towns, but starting from the second wave (ESS2, 2013/2014), the coverage was expanded to all urban areas, ensuring nationally representative estimates. The ESS1, ESS2, and ESS3 waves constitute Panel I, while ESS4 initiates a new panel, serving as the baseline for future surveys. The survey provides information on household structure, employment, income, consumption, education, health, access to infrastructure, and characteristics of the agricultural sector. One of its key features is the combination of household survey data with administrative records and remote sensing technologies, such as satellite imagery, to improve the accuracy of economic and social indicator estimates. 1.1.1 Data Source The ESS4 was implemented by the CSA of Ethiopia, in collaboration with the World Bank and other international organizations. Data collection was conducted through direct interviews with selected households, using electronic devices through Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). The database includes detailed information on: Household structure and sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, education, health). Living conditions and economic well-being (income, consumption, access to services). Housing characteristics (construction materials, access to drinking water, sanitation, and electricity). Food security and agricultural production (crops, livestock, access to markets). Access to financing and land tenure. Mobility and migration (internal displacement and job seeking). The ESS4 not only allows for the generation of descriptive statistics on the Ethiopian population but also facilitates longitudinal studies to assess changes in living conditions over time. 1.1.2 Sampling Design The ESS4 follows a probabilistic, stratified, and two-stage sampling design, ensuring representative coverage at the national and regional levels. 1.1.2.1 Sampling Frame The sample selection was based on the updated cartography from the 2018 Population and Housing Census, ensuring an updated and accurate sampling frame. First Stage: Selection of Enumeration Areas (EAs) In rural areas, Enumeration Areas (EAs) were selected from the sample of the Annual Agricultural Sample Survey (AgSS) using simple random sampling. In urban areas, the selection was carried out through systematic sampling with probability proportional to size (PPS). A total of 565 EAs were selected, of which 316 were rural and 249 were urban. Second Stage: Selection of Households Within each selected EA, households were sampled using systematic random sampling: Rural areas: 10 agricultural households and 2 non-agricultural households were selected per EA. Urban areas: 15 households were selected per EA, regardless of their economic activity. The final planned sample comprised 7,527 households, although due to security constraints, only 6,770 households in 535 EAs could be interviewed.

"],["definición-del-diseño-muestral-en-r.html", "1.2 Definición del diseño muestral en R", " 1.2 Definición del diseño muestral en R First, the necessary libraries are loaded: haven to read data files in .sav format (SPSS), dplyr for data manipulation, survey for the analysis of complex surveys, and srvyr, which is an extension of survey with a syntax similar to dplyr. library(haven) # Para leer archivos .sav library(dplyr) # Para manipulación de datos library(survey) # Para análisis de encuestas complejas library(srvyr) library(magrittr) Next, the data is loaded from an .rds file using the readRDS function. The data is stored in the object dat_Hogar. Then, the relevant columns for the analysis are selected using the transmute function. These columns include: household_id (unique household identifier), ea_id (unique identifier for the enumeration area, representing the primary sampling units), saq14 (variable indicating whether the household is rural (1) or urban (2)), saq02 (region or district code), saq01 (region code), and pw_w4 (final adjusted weight for the fourth wave of the survey, necessary for weighted analysis). dat_Hogar &lt;- readRDS(&quot;data/data_ESS4/sect1_hh_w4.rds&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(strata = paste0(saq01, &quot;_&quot;, saq14) ) Finally, the complex survey design is defined using the as_survey_design function from the srvyr package. This design considers: ids = ~ ea_id to specify the primary sampling units (enumeration areas), strata = ~ saq01 + saq14 to define stratification by region and urban/rural area, weights = ~ pw_w4 to assign sampling weights, and nest = TRUE to indicate that the cluster identifiers are nested within the strata. This survey design is essential for performing statistical analyses that take into account the complex structure of the survey, such as estimating means, hat_Ns, or regressions. # Definir el diseño muestral design_sampleing &lt;- dat_Hogar %&gt;% # Base de datos as_survey_design( ids = ea_id, # Identificador de las unidades primarias de muestreo (EA) strata = strata, # Estratificación por región (saq01) y zona urbana/rural (saq14) weights = pw_w4, # Peso final ajustado nest = TRUE ) "],["frequencies-and-proportions.html", "1.3 Frequencies and proportions", " 1.3 Frequencies and proportions In the following section, we illustrate the estimation process using R routines, specifically for computing hat_Ns and proportions. We begin by describing the routine for estimating the hat_N number of people by region. When some strata contain only one cluster (PSU), variance estimation errors may occur. To address this, you can use the following option: options(survey.lonely.psu = \"adjust\") This adjustment ensures that the variance is computed for strata with a single cluster rather than discarding them, leading to more robust variance estimation. The process starts by converting the Region variable into a factor using as_factor(saq01), ensuring it is treated as a categorical variable. Next, the data is grouped by Region using group_by(Region). Within each group, the hat_N estimate of the variable of interest is calculated using the survey_hat_N() function. This function provides estimates of the population hat_N along with key precision metrics, including the coefficient of variation (cv), standard error (se), and confidence intervals (ci). options(survey.lonely.psu = &quot;fail&quot;) # Tiene error cuando uso adjust design_sampleing &lt;- design_sampleing %&gt;% mutate(Region = as_factor(saq01)) tab_01 &lt;- design_sampleing %&gt;% group_by(Region) %&gt;% survey_tally(vartype = c(&quot;cv&quot;, &quot;se&quot;, &quot;ci&quot;), proportion = TRUE, prop_method = &quot;logit&quot; name = &quot;hat_N&quot;) After calculating these values, transformations are applied to improve their presentation: hat_N is rounded to the nearest integer. hat_N_cv is multiplied by 100 and rounded to two decimal places to express it as a percentage. hat_N_se, hat_N_low (lower limit of the confidence interval), and hat_N_upp (upper limit of the confidence interval) are rounded to integer values. Finally, the resulting table (tab_01) is saved to the file \"data/tables/secc3/tab_01.rds\" using saveRDS() tab_01 &lt;- tab_01 %&gt;% mutate( hat_N = round(hat_N), hat_N_cv = round(hat_N_cv * 100 , 2), hat_N_se = round(hat_N_se), hat_N_low = round(hat_N_low), hat_N_upp = round(hat_N_upp) ) saveRDS(tab_01, &quot;data/tablas/secc3/tab_01.rds&quot;) The results present population estimates for different regions along with their respective coefficients of variation (CV), standard errors (SE), and confidence intervals (CI). In terms of data quality, larger regions, such as Oromia and Amhara, exhibit lower coefficients of variation (3.23% and 2.48%, respectively), indicating greater precision in their estimates. On the other hand, smaller regions, such as Afar (10.03%) and Benishangul Gumuz (6.79%), show relatively high CV values, suggesting greater uncertainty in their estimates. The standard error (SE) is higher in regions with larger populations, such as Oromia (1,151,677) and Amhara (531,161), which is expected since absolute variability increases with population size. However, when considering the CV, it remains within acceptable levels for most regions. Confidence intervals (CI) help assess the reliability of the estimates. In general, regions with higher CV values have wider confidence intervals, reflecting greater uncertainty. For instance, Afar has a confidence interval of approximately ±169,061 people, whereas in Amhara, the range is relatively narrower at ±1,043,026 people. This suggests that estimates in smaller regions may be less precise and could benefit from increased sample coverage or refinements in the sampling design.

DIRE DAWA 409426 4.69 19196 371714 447139 1.3.1 Demographic Characteristics The code begins by transforming the design_sampleing dataset using the mutate function, creating new variables derived from age (s1q03a). Three age group classifications are defined: Age_Group0_5 (children under 6 and the rest), Age_Group0_9 (children under 10 and the rest), and Age_Group, which categorizes ages into three groups: 0 - 14, 15 - 64, and 65 +. design_sampleing %&lt;&gt;% mutate( Age_Group0_5 = case_when(s1q03a &lt; 6 ~ &quot;0 - 5&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;6 +&quot;), Age_Group0_9 = case_when(s1q03a &lt; 10 ~ &quot;0 - 9&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;9 +&quot;), Age_Group = case_when(s1q03a &lt; 15 ~ &quot;0 - 14&quot;, s1q03a &lt; 65 ~ &quot;15 - 64&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;65 +&quot;)) Next, three tables (tab2.1_0_5, tab2.1_0_9, and tab2.1_0_14) are generated to summarize the population proportion for each age group by region. Each table groups the data by Region and the corresponding age variable, calculating the sample mean of the variable of interest using the survey_mean() function. Additionally, the proportion values are expressed as percentages and rounded to one decimal place. For the 0 - 5 and 0 - 9 age group tables, only the rows corresponding to these age groups are retained. tab2.1_0_5 &lt;- design_sampleing %&gt;% group_by(Region , Age_Group = Age_Group0_5) %&gt;% summarise(prop = survey_mean( vartype = c(&quot;cv&quot;, &quot;se&quot;, &quot;ci&quot;), proportion = TRUE, prop_method = &quot;logit&quot; )) %&gt;% mutate(prop = round(prop * 100, 1)) %&gt;% filter(Age_Group == &quot;0 - 5&quot;) tab2.1_0_9 &lt;- design_sampleing %&gt;% group_by(Region , Age_Group = Age_Group0_9) %&gt;% summarise(prop = survey_mean( vartype = c(&quot;cv&quot;, &quot;se&quot;, &quot;ci&quot;), proportion = TRUE, prop_method = &quot;logit&quot; )) %&gt;% mutate(prop = round(prop * 100, 1)) %&gt;% filter(Age_Group == &quot;0 - 9&quot;) tab2.1_0_14 &lt;- design_sampleing %&gt;% group_by(Region , Age_Group) %&gt;% summarise(prop = survey_mean( vartype = c(&quot;cv&quot;, &quot;se&quot;, &quot;ci&quot;), proportion = TRUE, prop_method = &quot;logit&quot; )) %&gt;% mutate(prop = round(prop * 100, 1)) These operations are then replicated in an additional dataset where the Region variable is set to \"Ethiopia\" instead of taking the information from the original dataset. This results in three new tables (tab2.1_0_5t, tab2.1_0_9t, and tab2.1_0_14t), processed in the same way as the previous ones but applied exclusively to Ethiopia. tab2.1_0_5t &lt;- design_sampleing %&gt;% group_by(Region = &quot;Ethiopia&quot;, Age_Group = Age_Group0_5) %&gt;% summarise(prop = survey_mean( vartype = c(&quot;cv&quot;, &quot;se&quot;, &quot;ci&quot;), proportion = TRUE, prop_method = &quot;logit&quot; )) %&gt;% mutate(prop = round(prop * 100, 1)) %&gt;% filter(Age_Group == &quot;0 - 5&quot;) tab2.1_0_9t &lt;- design_sampleing %&gt;% group_by(Region = &quot;Ethiopia&quot;, Age_Group = Age_Group0_9) %&gt;% summarise(prop = survey_mean( vartype = c(&quot;cv&quot;, &quot;se&quot;, &quot;ci&quot;), proportion = TRUE, prop_method = &quot;logit&quot; )) %&gt;% mutate(prop = round(prop * 100, 1)) %&gt;% filter(Age_Group == &quot;0 - 9&quot;) tab2.1_0_14t &lt;- design_sampleing %&gt;% group_by(Region = &quot;Ethiopia&quot;, Age_Group) %&gt;% summarise(prop = survey_mean( vartype = c(&quot;cv&quot;, &quot;se&quot;, &quot;ci&quot;), proportion = TRUE, prop_method = &quot;logit&quot; )) %&gt;% mutate(prop = round(prop * 100, 1)) Finally, all the generated tables are combined into a single table, tab_02, using bind_rows(), consolidating the results for all regions and Ethiopia into one data structure. The final table is saved as an .rds file in \"data/tablas/secc3/tab_02.rds\". tab_02 &lt;- bind_rows(tab2.1_0_14, tab2.1_0_9, tab2.1_0_5, tab2.1_0_14t, tab2.1_0_9t, tab2.1_0_5t) saveRDS(tab_02, &quot;data/tablas/secc3/tab_02.rds&quot;) The tables present population estimates by age group and place of residence in Ethiopia for the 2018/2019 period, along with their respective standard deviations. Overall, the proportion of the population in younger age groups (0 - 5, 0 - 9, and 0 - 14) is higher in regions such as Afar (46.4% in the 0 - 14 age group) and Somali (52.4% in the same group), indicating a younger population structure in these areas. In contrast, Addis Ababa has the lowest proportion of the population in the 0 - 14 age group (25.3%) and the highest in the 15 - 64 age group (70.4%), suggesting a more adult and urban demographic distribution.

In general, the values are relatively low, indicating stable estimates. However, some regions exhibit higher standard deviations in certain age groups, reflecting greater uncertainty in the estimation. For example, Benishangul Gumuz has a standard deviation of 2.93 for the 0 - 14 age group, suggesting relatively high variability in this category. Similarly, Afar shows a standard deviation of 2.03 in the 0 - 14 age group, indicating that the estimate for this region may be less precise. More urbanized regions, such as Addis Ababa, exhibit lower standard deviations across almost all age groups (e.g., 0.86 in the 0 - 14 age group and 0.74 in the 15 - 64 age group), indicating greater precision in the estimates for these areas. In contrast, regions with more dispersed and rural population structures show higher variations in estimates, reflecting greater uncertainty in data quality.
