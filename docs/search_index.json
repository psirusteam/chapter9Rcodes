[["index.html", "CHAPTER 9 - EXAMPLES IN R Abstract", " CHAPTER 9 - EXAMPLES IN R 2025-03-21 Abstract The Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS) is a nationally representative study conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA) in collaboration with the World Bank. Its objective is to collect detailed information on various aspects of Ethiopian households, such as expenditure on goods and services, income, employment, agricultural production, and living conditions. The data collected in the ESS are essential for policy formulation and evaluating the impact of development programs in the country. This survey enables the analysis of consumption patterns and economic inequalities across different regions, distinguishing between urban and rural areas to identify trends and specific population needs. In this study, multiple analyses have been conducted using ESS data, applying data processing and visualization techniques to examine household income and expenditure patterns. Bar charts have been created to illustrate the distribution of spending on non-food items, histograms to assess the density of expenditure across different categories, and scatter plots to explore the relationship between per capita income and expenditure. Additionally, weighted statistical models have been implemented, considering the survey’s sampling structure to ensure representative and robust estimates. These analyses help identify key differences in the economic behavior of Ethiopian households, providing valuable insights for designing interventions and policies aimed at improving the population’s well-being. "],["accounting-for-the-sampling-design.html", "Accounting for the Sampling Design", " Accounting for the Sampling Design The Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS4) is part of the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS), an initiative by the World Bank in collaboration with the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA). Its objective is to provide high-quality data for the analysis of poverty, food security, agricultural development, and other key socioeconomic aspects. The ESS4 is part of a series of longitudinal surveys initiated in 2011 under the name Ethiopia Rural Socioeconomic Survey (ERSS). In its first two rounds, the survey only covered rural areas and small towns, but starting from the second wave (ESS2, 2013/2014), the coverage was expanded to all urban areas, ensuring nationally representative estimates. The ESS1, ESS2, and ESS3 waves constitute Panel I, while ESS4 initiates a new panel, serving as the baseline for future surveys. The survey provides information on household structure, employment, income, consumption, education, health, access to infrastructure, and characteristics of the agricultural sector. One of its key features is the combination of household survey data with administrative records and remote sensing technologies, such as satellite imagery, to improve the accuracy of economic and social indicator estimates. "],["sample-design-of-the-ess4-20182019.html", "Sample design of the ESS4 2018/2019", " Sample design of the ESS4 2018/2019 The sampling design of ESS4 is based on a two-stage stratified probabilistic sampling, with different strategies for rural and urban areas. In the first stage, enumeration areas (EA) in rural zones were selected using simple random sampling (SRS) from a subsample of the 2018 Large-Scale Agricultural Survey (AgSS). In urban areas, EAs were directly selected from the urban frame using systematic sampling with probability proportional to size (PPS) within each region. This approach ensured a proportional allocation of the sample between urban and rural areas. In the second stage, households within each selected EA were chosen through systematic random sampling. In rural areas, 10 agricultural households were selected from the AgSS sample, along with 2 non-agricultural households, ensuring that the total number of agricultural households remained 10 when fewer than 2 non-agricultural households were available. In urban areas, 15 households per EA were selected, regardless of economic activity. A total of 7,527 households across 565 EAs were initially planned for the survey; however, due to security restrictions, the final number of completed surveys was 6,770 households across 535 EAs. This design ensures representative coverage of socioeconomic conditions in both rural and urban areas. "],["data-source.html", "Data Source", " Data Source The ESS4 was implemented by the CSA of Ethiopia, in collaboration with the World Bank and other international organizations. Data collection was conducted through direct interviews with selected households, using electronic devices through the Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) methodology. The database includes detailed information on various socioeconomic aspects, such as: Household structure and sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, education, health). Living conditions and economic well-being (income, consumption, access to services). Housing characteristics (construction materials, access to drinking water, sanitation, and electricity). Food security and agricultural production (crops, livestock, access to markets). Access to financing and land tenure. Mobility and migration (internal displacement and job seeking).

It then defines the complex survey design, applying the appropriate weights and stratification. Lastly, it validates the structure of the design and presents a summary of its implementation, ensuring that the estimates are representative at both national and regional levels. Prepare the work environment This R code sets up a clean and optimized environment for data analysis before executing any processing. First, it removes all previously loaded objects from memory and performs garbage collection to free up resources, preventing potential conflicts with data from previous sessions. Then, it loads a set of essential libraries for data manipulation and analysis, including packages specialized in survey data, efficient handling of large datasets, and formatting of results. Additionally, it ensures that the select function from dplyr is explicitly used to avoid conflicts with other libraries. Finally, the code adjusts the available RAM memory limit, optimizing performance for large-scale data processing. This setup is particularly useful in survey analysis and statistical studies that involve working with extensive datasets and computationally intensive calculations. #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# # Cleaning R Environment # #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# rm(list = ls()) gc() ## used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used (Mb) ## Ncells 542487 29.0 1219720 65.2 660485 35.3 ## Vcells 958338 7.4 8388608 64.0 1770410 13.6 #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# # Libraries # #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# library(tidyverse) library(survey) library(srvyr) library(data.table) library(magrittr) library(haven) library(stringr) library(tidyr) library(knitr) library(kableExtra) # Ensure select function from dplyr is used explicitly select &lt;- dplyr::select #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# # Setting the RAM Memory Limit # #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# memory.limit(250000000) ## [1] Inf Loading Datasets This R code loads and prepares a dataset for the ESS4 survey analysis. It uses the read_sav() function to import a SPSS (.sav) file, ensuring the correct reading of the database. Then, the select() function is applied to extract only the key variables, including unique household and enumeration area identifiers, geographic location information, and stratification into urban and rural areas. Additionally, the final adjusted sampling weight is included, which is essential for obtaining representative estimates. #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# # Loading Datasets # #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# # Household identification; location; household size and field staff identification HH_data &lt;- read_sav(&quot;data/data_ESS4/sect_cover_hh_w4.sav&quot;) %&gt;% select(household_id, # Unique Household Identifier ea_id, # Unique Enumeration Area Identifier saq14, # Area = Rural/Urban saq02, # Zone Code saq01, # Region Code pw_w4 # Final adjusted sampling weight ) This code generates two summary tables that count the enumeration areas and households by region and type of area (urban/rural). First, the ea_counts_by_region table calculates the number of enumeration areas (EA) in each region and zone. To achieve this, unique EAs are identified and grouped by region and area type (urban or rural). The structure is then reorganized using pivot_wider() to display the rural and urban categories as separate columns. Finally, the total number of EAs per region is calculated, and the columns are renamed for better clarity. On the other hand, the hh_counts_by_region table follows a similar process, but instead of counting EAs, it counts the number of households by region and area type. Unique households are extracted along with their respective region and zone, then grouped and counted by category. Subsequently, the data is reorganized using pivot_wider(), allowing urban and rural households to be distinguished in separate columns. Finally, the total number of households per region is calculated, and the columns are renamed to ensure a clear and consistent format. ea_counts_by_region &lt;- HH_data %&gt;% distinct(ea_id, saq14, saq01) %&gt;% mutate(saq14 = as_factor(saq14), saq01 = as_factor(saq01)) %&gt;% group_by(saq01, saq14) %&gt;% tally() %&gt;% pivot_wider( names_from = saq14, values_from = n, values_fill = list(n = 0) ) %&gt;% mutate(ea_counts_by_region = RURAL + URBAN) %&gt;% rename_with( ~ paste0(., &quot;_ea_id&quot;), c(&quot;RURAL&quot;, &quot;URBAN&quot;)) # Count of Households (HH) by region and area (urban/rural) categories hh_counts_by_region &lt;- HH_data %&gt;% distinct(household_id, saq01, saq14) %&gt;% mutate(saq14 = as_factor(saq14), saq01 = as_factor(saq01)) %&gt;% group_by(saq01, saq14) %&gt;% tally() %&gt;% pivot_wider( names_from = saq14, values_from = n, values_fill = list(n = 0) ) %&gt;% mutate(TOTAL_HH = RURAL + URBAN) %&gt;% rename_with( ~ paste0(., &quot;_HH&quot;), c(&quot;RURAL&quot;, &quot;URBAN&quot;)) # Merging both datasets on saq01 temp &lt;- inner_join(hh_counts_by_region, ea_counts_by_region) This R code generates a final summary of the survey results, including an additional row with the total consolidated for “ETHIOPIA”. To achieve this, it combines the regional data stored in temp with a new row representing the sum of all regions. This aggregation is performed using summarise_if(is.numeric, sum), ensuring that all numeric variables are correctly summed, while the region column (saq01) is manually assigned as “ETHIOPIA”. Next, the dataset is reorganized using select(), where key variables are renamed for better clarity. The resulting table includes the number of rural and urban households, the number of enumeration areas for each type of zone, and the total counts of households and enumeration areas. Finally, it is converted into a data frame to facilitate manipulation and visualization. This process provides a structured view of the distribution of the population and enumeration areas, allowing for both regional analysis and a consolidated national overview. # Summarizing the results including an additional row for &quot;ETHIOPIA&quot; survey_counts &lt;- bind_rows( temp, temp %&gt;% data.frame() %&gt;% summarise_if(is.numeric, sum) %&gt;% mutate(saq01 = &quot;ETHIOPIA&quot;) ) %&gt;% select( Region = saq01, RURAL_HH, RURAL_AE = RURAL_ea_id, URBAN_HH, URBAN_AE = URBAN_ea_id, TOTAL_HH, TOTAL_AE = ea_counts_by_region ) %&gt;% data.frame() # Display final result data.frame(survey_counts) The table summarizes the distribution of households and enumeration areas (EA) by region in Ethiopia, distinguishing between rural and urban areas. Nationally, the sample includes 6,770 households and 535 EAs, with a relatively balanced distribution between urban and rural areas. The regions with the highest number of rural households are Amhara (479), Oromia (453), and SNNP (422), while Addis Ababa is entirely urban (778 households and 52 EAs). In terms of EAs, Amhara and Oromia lead in rural areas, while Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa have higher urban concentrations.

First, a new variable strata is created by combining the region (saq01) with the urban/rural classification (saq14), allowing for proper stratification of the design. Then, the dataset HH_data is converted into a survey design (as_survey_design()), specifying: - ids = ea_id: Identifier of the primary sampling unit (enumeration area, EA). - strata = strata: Stratification by region and urban/rural area. - weights = pw_w4: Use of the adjusted sampling weight to obtain representative estimates. - nest = TRUE: Indicates that sampling units are nested within strata. #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# # Defining the survey design #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# ESS4_design &lt;- HH_data %&gt;% mutate(strata = paste0(saq01, &quot;_&quot;, saq14)) %&gt;% as_survey_design( ids = ea_id, # Primary sampling unit identifier (EA) strata = strata, # Stratification by region (saq01) and urban/rural zone (saq14) weights = pw_w4, # Final adjusted weight nest = TRUE ) Additionally, the option survey.lonely.psu = \"fail\" is set, causing the code to produce an error if a stratum has only a single, non-certainty primary sampling unit (PSU), ensuring a correctly specified survey design. Finally, summary(ESS4_design) is used to display a summary of the design, allowing verification of its structure before analysis. # Makes it an error to have a stratum with a single, non-certainty PSU options(survey.lonely.psu = &quot;fail&quot;) summary(ESS4_design) ## Stratified 1 - level Cluster Sampling design (with replacement) ## With (535) clusters. ## Called via srvyr ## Probabilities: ## Min. 1st Qu.

The stratification combines the region and the urban/rural classification, ensuring representativeness at both levels. The sample includes 535 clusters (PSU), and the number of primary sampling units in each stratum matches the planned design, indicating a consistent execution. The selection probabilities vary by region and area type, reflecting a sampling design adjusted to the population’s characteristics. Overall, these results validate the sampling structure and ensure that the derived estimates are representative at both the national and regional levels, accounting for geographic distribution and urban-rural stratification. "],["frequencies-and-proportions.html", "3.1 Frequencies and Proportions", " 3.1 Frequencies and Proportions This code block sets up the working environment for a new section of the analysis, focused on calculating frequencies and proportions based on the ESS4 survey design. Although this structure was defined earlier in the manual, it is repeated here to ensure that execution remains self-contained, reproducible, and free from interference from previous sections. Prepare the work environment This code block marks the beginning of a new working session, following the same methodological line established earlier. Its main purpose is to prepare a clean, efficient, and fully loaded environment to continue with the processing and analysis of the survey data. By resetting the R environment, reloading the necessary libraries, and adjusting the memory settings, this ensures that any subsequent analysis is carried out in a controlled manner, free from interference by previous objects or configurations. This approach is especially useful when working with modular scripts, such as in a manual, as it allows each section to be executed independently, ensuring reproducibility and consistency throughout the entire workflow. #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# # Cleaning R Environment # #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# rm(list = ls()) gc() ## used (Mb) gc trigger (Mb) max used (Mb) ## Ncells 554800 29.7 1241915 66.4 686454 36.7 ## Vcells 982594 7.5 8388608 64.0 1876235 14.4 #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# # Libraries # #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# library(tidyverse) library(survey) library(srvyr) library(data.table) library(magrittr) library(haven) library(stringr) library(tidyr) library(knitr) library(kableExtra) # Ensure select function from dplyr is used explicitly select &lt;- dplyr::select #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# # Setting the RAM Memory Limit # #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# memory.limit(250000000) ## [1] Inf This block continues the analysis, focusing on the processing of household consumption expenditure and participation in various items over the past 12 months.

Based on the defined survey design, two main estimates are produced: N_hat: the estimated total number of households reporting expenditures on each item, along with its standard error and coefficient of variation. P_hat: the estimated proportion of households who reported spending, including its standard error, coefficient of variation, and a 95% confidence interval. These estimates provide insight into both the magnitude and coverage of consumption across different categories of goods and services at the national level. #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# # TABLE 7.3 # Spending on Nonfood Items and Services # # ESS4 Sampled EAs and Households by Region and by Urban and Rural # Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS) 2018/19 # SURVEY REPORT # Central Statistics Agency of Ethiopia | World Bank #------------------------------------------------------------------------------# tab_01 &lt;- ESS4_design %&gt;% group_by(item = item_cd_12months) %&gt;% summarise( N_hat = survey_total(yes_no, na.rm = TRUE, vartype = c(&quot;se&quot;, &quot;cv&quot;)), # Absolute size P_hat = survey_mean(yes_no, na.rm = TRUE, vartype = c(&quot;se&quot;, &quot;cv&quot;, &quot;ci&quot;)) # Proportions ) Formatting and presenting results In this block, the previously computed results are transformed into a reader-friendly table.
