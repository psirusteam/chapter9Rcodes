# Introduction {-}

According to the @WB, the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS) is a nationally representative study conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA) in collaboration with the World Bank. Its objective is to collect detailed information on various aspects of Ethiopian households, such as expenditure on goods and services, income, employment, agricultural production, and living conditions. The data collected in the ESS are essential for policy formulation and evaluating the impact of development programs in the country. This survey enables the analysis of consumption patterns and economic inequalities across different regions, distinguishing between urban and rural areas to identify trends and specific population needs.

In this appendix, we have conducted multiple analyses using ESS data in order to exemplify how a household survey can be analyzed using the R software [@R_2025]. Readers of Chapter 9 will be able to reproduce the same outputs by correctly executing the codes presented in this appendix.
